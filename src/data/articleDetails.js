Given this manufacturing industry, the size of interplanetary shipments from and to the planet is huge.</p>
      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>While rich in manufacturing and technology, the planet is actually poor in natural resources. The core of the planet has been mined empty millennia ago. That's why they depend on resource shipments from other planets. One of the most important resources is Zellenite, the mineral from Kaaru.</p>
      <h2>Mythology and Legends</h2>
      <p>Being such a science and technology oriented society, they mostly don't have much of religion, however, they celebrate festivals from time to time as an excuse to connect in person, being separated by long distances most of the time. They had a religion many years before, worshiping the god Mechra, patron of all advancement.</p>

      <p>The Levian Clan of Mytheann is a distinguished group within the society of Mytheann, renowned for their mastery of Graviturgy, which they specifically apply to the art of architecture and construction. Their expertise in manipulating gravitational forces to float objects has made them the primary architects and builders on the planet, responsible for the creation of Mytheann's iconic floating cities and platforms.</p>
      <p>The Levian Clan's role in Mytheann society is not merely functional but also deeply symbolic. Their work embodies the Mytheanns' philosophy of Gravitational Harmony, as they ensure that every structure they create is in balance with the planet's unique gravitational flux. This philosophy extends beyond the physical balance of their constructions; it is a reflection of the Mytheanns' desire for harmony within their society and the universe at large.</p>
      <p>The Levian Scepter, a revered artifact of the clan, symbolizes their authority and is used in ceremonial functions. It is said to be imbued with the ability to canalize the user's gravity control with unprecedented precision, a testament to the clan's architectural achievements and their deep understanding of Graviturgy.</p>
      <p>The Levian Clan's architectural feats are not only practical but also artistic.

      <p>The clan's influence extends beyond architecture; they are integral to the governance of Mytheann as part of the Council of Elders. A representative of the Levian Clan sits on the council, ensuring that the principles of Gravitational Harmony guide the decisions that shape the destiny of the planet.</p>
      <p>The Levian Clan's contributions to Mytheann's culture are celebrated during events such as the Dance of the Spheres, where their architectural marvels provide a backdrop for the sacred ritual. Their work is a constant reminder of the Mytheanns' connection to the cosmos and their commitment to maintaining balance in all aspects of life.</p>
      <p>As Mytheanns explore beyond their planet, the Levian Clan faces new challenges and opportunities to apply their Graviturgy skills. Their ethical stance on using their powers to intervene in other societies is cautious, reflecting their dedication to balance and peace. However, their expertise may prove invaluable in fostering cooperation with other civilizations, as seen in their role within the Gravity Union, a partnership with the planet Nakrozel.</p>
      <p>In summary, the Levian Clan is a pillar of Mytheann society, embodying the artistry, philosophy, and governance of a people deeply connected to the gravitational forces that define their existence. Their work ensures that Mytheann remains a hidden gem in the cosmos, a world where architecture and nature exist in perfect equilibrium.</p>

    content: `
      <p>The Phobetra Mining Consortium is a powerful organization that holds a monopoly over mining operations on the moon of Phobetra, a colony of the planet Kaaru. The moon is rich in rare minerals not found on Kaaru, which led to the establishment of the consortium. The consortium exports these valuable materials back to Kaaru and other interstellar markets, contributing significantly to the economy of the colony and beyond.</p>
      <p>The consortium was established shortly after Phobetra was founded as a mining outpost nearly a century ago. Over time, as the outpost expanded into a self-sufficient colony, the consortium's influence and operations likely grew as well. Today, it plays a crucial role in the colony's prosperity and has a significant impact on interstellar trade.</p>
      <p>However, the consortium's activities have sparked ethical debates due to the discovery of unique microorganisms and possibly larger underground life forms on Phobetra. Movements are urging for a more ecological approach to mining and protection laws for native life forms, much like the ones on Kaaru. The consortium's future actions and policies may be influenced by these debates.</p>
      <h2>Covert Operation</h2>
      <p>The Bloodstone Scourge, an interplanetary criminal syndicate, initiated a covert operation against the Phobetra Mining Consortium approximately 20 years ago. This operation was part of their larger plan to gain control over valuable resources across different planetary systems.</p>
      <p>The Phobetra Mining Consortium was a prime target due to its rich deposits of rare minerals not found on Kaaru. These minerals were crucial to the economy of the colony and beyond, making them a valuable asset for the Scourge.</p>
      <p>The Scourge, known for their brutal efficiency and complex hierarchy, deployed a team of their highly skilled enforcers, the Cardinal Shadows, to infiltrate the Consortium. They used a combination of subtle tactics and violent measures, including assassinations and replacements of key figures within the Consortium with Scourge Operatives. This allowed them to slowly gain control over the Consortium's operations from within.</p>
      <p>Simultaneously, the Scourge also manipulated networks of intermediaries and corrupt government officials on Phobetra, ensuring they could siphon off a large portion of the Consortium's profits without raising suspicion. This not only increased their wealth but also allowed them to exert strategic economic influence over the colony and other interstellar markets that depended on the minerals.</p>
      <p>The operation was conducted from their headquarters, the Black Fortress, located in the hazardous Outland Belt. The location's natural defenses and the Fortress's state-of-the-art security made it nearly impossible for the Consortium or any other parties to trace the operation back to the Scourge.</p>
      <p>This illegal corporate scheme remained hidden for years, allowing the Bloodstone Scourge to amass significant wealth and power. However, the full extent of their infiltration and the long-term impacts on the Phobetra Mining Consortium and the wider interstellar economy are still being uncovered.</p>

      <p>Valendorians are the inhabitants of the technologically advanced planet Valendor, also known as Mechron. They live and work in a highly automated society, often alongside machines. Many Valendorians choose to augment their bodies with cybernetics, with some even opting to become cyborgs, fully integrating their consciousness into mechanical bodies.</p>
      <p>Their society is governed by a planet-wide Artificial Intelligence, which ensures fair and productive policies for all Valendorians. This AI governance is a testament to their technological prowess and their trust in the efficiency and impartiality of machines.</p>
      <p>Despite their technological orientation, Valendorians have a cultural history rooted in mythology. They once worshipped Mechra, the god of advancement, and while formal religion has largely faded, they still celebrate occasional festivals as a means of social connection.</p>
      <p>Valendorians are also known for their manufacturing capabilities, which form the backbone of their economy. They produce a wide range of technological elements used by other planets, from health systems to weapons. This has led to a significant interplanetary trade, with large shipments of goods regularly leaving and arriving on Valendor.</p>
      <p>However, Valendor faces challenges due to its lack of natural resources, having mined its core empty millennia ago. As a result, the Valendorians depend heavily on resource shipments from other planets, with Zellenite from Kaaru being one of the most important imports.</p>
      <p>Despite these challenges, the Valendorians continue to thrive, their society a testament to the power of technology and the resilience of their people.</p>

      <p>The flying bikes used in the races represent custom-built vehicles, as each character has their own bike that they built themselves.</p>

      <h2>Standard Features</h2>
      <p>Most ether bikes incorporate similar core technology. They typically include a main thruster (usually a jet engine), aerodynamic fins for steering and basic Repulsors for hovering. Beyond these fundamentals, pilots and engineers add personalized systems tailored to their specific needs and preferences.</p>

      <h2>Customization & Modifications</h2>
      <p>Designs vary significantly between pilots. Additional technology focuses on improved controls, direct cybernetic interfaces and other modifications, allowing each racer to optimize their vehicle's performance according to their flying style.</p>

      <h2>Pilot Preparation</h2>
      <p>Racing at extreme speeds requires physiological adaptation. Pilots often drink a special beverage called GX Compound that hardens their cells temporarily and slows their metabolism to withstand intense acceleration forces.</p>

      <h2>Advanced Variants</h2>
      <p>Some racers push boundaries further with rocket engines or ion thrusters and RCS for using them off the atmosphere, wearing space suits. These modifications enable off-world racing capabilities beyond atmospheric conditions.</p>
